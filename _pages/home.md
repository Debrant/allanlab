This is a test site for all types of writing, or at least all types that are written by me.

## Personal:

#### I love stories, history and culture. I have been blessed with a freedom that has  allowed me to travel extensively, wear many hats, and redefine myself as needed along the way.

#### I have always been passionate about story telling, and exploring that craft is one of the main reasons I started this site. Along the way I decided it was also a good place to hold other things of interest that I am working on. I  have been using the site to explore Web Development, and I am currently using Jekyll, a Ruby based, blog aware, static website maker. I will probably change the styling several times until I find my own way of doing things, but for the time being I have been hacking the Jeckyll theme, [Allan Lab](http://www.allanlab.org/aboutwebsite.html).

#### I am still figuring out the best organizational scheme, for the time being I have settled in to using tags and categories to sort my writing.  You may find random vignettes, side projects, poetry, fiction and academic writing depending on where you click.

## Education:
#### I studied Electrical Engineering & Physics locally at the  at  [PSU](https://www.pdx.edu) and am currently taking my time writing my thesis,   **"A Dynamic model of trust for IOT Devices."** In which I try to create a lightweight machine learning algorithm that will be capable of making situationally appropriate decisions other than just pass/ fail.


## Professional:

#### I am currently the Director of Operations at [TigerStop](https://www.tigerstop.com/), having worked my way up through the ranks from design engineer to get here. TigerStop is a world leader in automatic and stop gauge technology. Even so, our team of dedicated engineers in R&D work to expand our product lines into manufacturing markets in need of impactful and creative solutions. We believe that manufacturing is an essential cornerstone of a healthy community.  


#### As a non-traditional engineer I bring the insight gained through decades of experience across multiple industries. As a leader I strive to inspire creativity, flexibility and stewardship.
